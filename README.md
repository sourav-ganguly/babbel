- For Correct Guess +1 point
- For Incorrect Guess -1 point
- Total 20 chances


## Time
Around 8 hours spent in total for completing the task.

## time distributed
- For View: 3
- For ViewModel: 3
- For Data fetching: 1
- For Documentation: 1

## decisions made because of restricted time
I could not write or think about Unit testing for restricted time. 

## first thing to improve or add if there had been more time
- I would write Unit testing for the View Model class and Repository class
- Though I desined the classes to be use with dependency injection, but did not inject dependency from a different class. I would do that. 
- I would make the UI a little bit nicer.
